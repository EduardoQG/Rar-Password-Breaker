# Rar-Password-Breaker
Simple script for bruteforce Rar files cracking

This is a rar files cracker that uses two lists of frequently used passwords. This lists where taken from this project (https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists).
The script is written in Python and uses bruteforce to find the right key to open the file.

I am making this project for studying and practising.
